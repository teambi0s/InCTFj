XOR haunts again

Looks like before Alice gave the key in wrong hands and someone misused it ;). This time the ciphertext is given to you and seems like the magic of XOR has been done on it again! Can you decrypt the given ciphertext and get the original message back?

The ciphertext has been encoded in one of the common encoding format.

Ciphertext: 11161b0c1e12031d0c270c0d271a0a0d0c1d272d271f170c27110c270a0c05

Hint:
What do you do when you have a bunch of keys and don’t know which one opens lock?
